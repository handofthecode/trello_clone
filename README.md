This is a Trello Clone

Purpose: This project was built from scratch over a 15 day period. My goal was to replicate the Trello UI and functionality within the allotted time.

Approach:
The front-end is built on backbone and uses handlebars templating.
The back-end relies on express and a simple json file to store nested data.
Download the Trello Clone Presentation.pdf for more details.

Features:
You can create lists and populate them with cards.
You can add descriptions to the cards.
You can drag cards between lists.
You can drag lists and reorganize everything.
You can search for cards by title and description.
You can edit everthing.
